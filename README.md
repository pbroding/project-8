<h2>Use Linux commands to manage file permissions</h2>
<h4>Welcome to my cybersecurity lab, where I've delved into the incredible capabilities of the Linux command line for updating permissions across users, groups, and more. In this project, I've demonstrated the pivotal role of Linux in strengthening cybersecurity practices, and how this open-source operating system plays a critical role in information security.</h4>

<h4>Two Accessible Formats: To ensure the knowledge is easily accessible, I've provided the lab report in both Microsoft Word and PDF formats. This flexibility allows you to choose the medium that suits your preferences and enhances your learning experience.</h4>
